# mnist-wasm

_In Progress_

# Idea

1. Create a NN inside of the browser using wasm.
2. Load weights from an API, and allow people to update weights (by drawing on a canvas and labeling)
3. Post weights to API.
4. Build a POC training system completely in the browser.
5. Use Rust for wasm and api.

This is for fun to write an nn from scratch and also do some fun rust wasm stuff.
